ENSF381 Lab2 Repository

## How we did the exercises
- The first thing we did was make a repo and then we added the images HTML
### Next:
- Jaisumer Sandhu, made the images.html and edited the file so that it fits the comments' descriptions
- Tahil looked over it and made minor changes
### Next:
- Tahil added the images files and also the news file to start working on that
- He then followed the comments to alter the news.html file so that it fits the comments' descriptions
- After making changes we both looked at it and reviewed for any mistakes
### Next:
- Jaisumer then started working on the index.html file and started to add the 'href's and also then made changes to the news and images file to make sure all three websites are linked
- Next, Jaisumer made a video on how to navigate between the websites and then made a gif out of the video and added it to the index file
### Lastly:
- We both looked over the entire assignment through Jaisumer's computer and kept making changes to the file for any minor mistakes and git comitted after every minor change
